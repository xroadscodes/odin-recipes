            <li>1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional</li>
            <li>8 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add Italian sausage and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the sausage as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, garlic powder and red pepper flakes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and stir in pasta and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer until pasta is cooked through, about 13-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in mozzarella and Parmesan until well combined. Using a small cookie scoop, top with dollops of ricotta and cover until heated through, about 2-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
